# Professional Experience

I have been a professional software developer for over a decade, with an extensive background in Computer Science (including a M.S. in C.S.).

For the past 4 years, I have been in a management role, and I am blessed to be able to mentor and grow my team every day.

Here is [my current resume](https://lukep.dev/assets/Luke%20Paireepinart%20Resume.pdf) and my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luke-paireepinart).

Please feel free to reach out! I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities.

# Open-Source

I am a huge believer in Open-Source software. I have created several projects myself, and I am also a maintainer.

## My Projects

### [ESC POS .NET](https://github.com/lukevp/ESC-POS-.NET)

- .NET Standard application for efficient, easy to use thermal printing & POS device control
- Cross Platform - compatible with Windows, Linux, and OSX
- WiFi, Bluetooth, USB and Ethernet Support
- Over 5k installs through NuGet and 95+ stars on GitHub make this one of the most popular libraries for .NET thermal printing, despite being much newer than competitors

### [FiRDP](https://github.com/lukevp/FiRDP)

- FiRDP is a blazing fast RDP solution. It consists of a lightweight agent in Rust, a backend gateway, and an HTML5 frontend that requires no dedicated end-user software
- FiRDP is currently very alpha, and is not ready for widespread use, but if you are interested in the process of building a [Rust](https://rustlang.org) RDP application, feel free to watch/star the repo to receive updates!

### [Found](https://github.com/lukevp/Found)

- Found is a new search engine. Several core services will eventually be written in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) and cross-compiled via [WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/), but is currently implemented in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs on top of [Deno](https://deno.land/).
- There is currently a frequency-based radix trie implemented for extremely fast retrieval of terms, for use in an autocomplete.
- In the future, there will be range-based and full-text TF-IDF query support, along with optional persistence, to enable automatic and high performance document indexing and querying within the browser

### [My GitHub](https://lukep.dev/github)

- I have several projects on my github that are not listed above. Please check them out and give them a star or a follow!

## Projects I'm a maintainer for

### [React-xterm](https://github.com/farfromrefug/react-xterm)

- React component for using the great [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/) library, which is the terminal used by [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
