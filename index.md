# Professional Experience

I have been a professional software engineer for over a decade, with an extensive background in Computer Science (including an M.S. in C.S.).

I have also spent 4+ years in a management role.  I am blessed to be able to mentor and grow teams every day.

# Open-Source

I am a huge believer in Open-Source software. I have created several projects myself, and I am also a maintainer.
